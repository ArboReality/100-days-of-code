# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30th 2023

**Today's Progress**: Reached 30% completion of freecodecamp's [React Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react)

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
