### Day 2: January 31th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Reached 51% on freecodecamp's [React Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react) 

Learned how to
  1. pass an array as a prop
  2. use defaultProps
  3. define PropTypes
  4. create a stateful component
  5. use setState to update component prop values!

**Thoughts:** 
So far a lot of fun, but I want to find a way to apply what I learn somehow...
